# Homework 2 Assignment

## Courtney Thomas

## This week's workflow

This week, I had the following workflow as I worked on the assignment;

1. Downloaded software
2. Attended office hours
3. Did Homework 2
  - Learned how to create;
    - Headers
    - Lists
    - Link to another site
  - Continued to learn Git and GitHub

## Resources I used for Homework 2

This week I had to use many resources besides attending office hours, one of them being the [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

I had to remind myself that it is a three step process.

#### 1 stage files

The first, begin by staging the files

```bash

```
